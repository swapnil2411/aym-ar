                            As a responsible business that aspires to actively
contribute to the climate action agenda, we have
undertaken bold steps and commitments to go beyond
compliance boundaries, proactively reducing our overall
emissionsâ€™ footprint across operations. These commitments
have been consolidated to form our net zero emission
reduction targets in operations. AYM Syntex is committed
to gradually reducing its carbon footprint in the coming
decades through a combination of strategic thinking and
innovative action.
<br>
<br>
The Company realises its impact on the environment as
it continues to grow in scale and stature. While it has
always believed in sustainable business practices, it
now hopes to take more pragmatic and meaningful
steps towards becoming a net-zero institution in a
reasonably short timeline. 
<br>
<br>
As we adopt newer technologies to enhance our capacity
and productivity, our operations continue to become
more energy-efficient and, in the process, greener. AYM
aspires to be a sustainable organisation by implementing
business strategies that create significant stakeholder
value. A comprehensive environmental focused strategy
framework with an articulated net-zero commitment
vision helps the Company take its intent forward and
demonstrates its unwavering commitment to serve
society and create value for its stakeholders. We expect
that our actions in the upcoming period will allow us to
proactively meet the expectations that will be set forth
for sustainable environmental friendly and inclusive
growth.
